## Numerical solution of the steady-state hydrodynamic and thermal boundary  layer equations on a flat plate using the shooting method

The shooting method is a numerical technique used to solve boundary value problems. In the Blasius equation, which is a third-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation, the shooting method can be an efficient tool for finding the velocity distribution in fluid flow over a flat plate. To use the shooting method for solving this equation, the boundary value problem must first be converted into an initial value problem. This is typically done by guessing an appropriate value for the initial derivatives at the boundary, and then using an IVP solver, such as the Runge- Kutta method, to solve the problem. By solving the Blasius equation, velocity profiles, streamlines, and thermal lines can be extracted. In all the equations, the properties of air were considered. This study is based on the book "Convection heat transfer" by Adrian Bejan.
